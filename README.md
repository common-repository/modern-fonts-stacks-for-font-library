# Modern Fonts Stacks for WordPress Font Library

[An user review](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/maybe-the-last-font-stacks-youll-ever-need-a-must-have-for-fse-users/): 

The ‚ÄúModern Font Stacks‚Äù are 15 handpicked font families that ensure a similar look and feel of your text across platforms, be it Windows, macOS, Linux or mobile devices, in the fastest and most robust way possible ‚Äî by using the best system fonts available.

No external downloads are necessary. No ‚Äúflash of unstyled text‚Äù. There are no privacy issues.

Search for ‚ÄúModern Font Stacks‚Äù on your favorite search engine for the full story; you won‚Äôt regret it.

You can add these font stacks to your theme via theme.json, which is not overly technical, just a bit cumbersome ‚Äî or ‚Äî you can use the ‚ÄúModern Fonts for Font Library‚Äù plugin, which does just that for you. Afterward, the new font stacks will be available in the typography settings of your full site editing theme and, as a result, in the block editor for your content.

Worried about long-time support? Don‚Äôt be. The system fonts aren‚Äôt going anywhere, and you can at any time replace the ‚ÄúModern Font for Font Library‚Äù plugin with a few lines of custom CSS or the mentioned addition to theme.json.

I‚Äôve built numerous sites using Modern Font Stacks. Having a good selection of beautiful and efficient fonts for body text, script, monospaced text, etc. means that I can often avoid external fonts entirely, or just use a single external font for branding or headings. This results in a super-fast user experience.
